Hi there ✌️ nice to meet you! I'm a **Backend Developer** and **Data Scientist** based out of Tamil Nadu, India.

I'm passionate about building intelligent solutions that solve real-world problems. I specialize in creating scalable backend systems and developing AI-powered applications that enhance decision-making. I’ve worked extensively on performance management systems, personalized course recommenders, and smart email management platforms. I primarily code in **Python** and **Typescript**, while exploring cutting-edge AI and data-driven technologies.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new AI trends 🤖, working out 🏋️‍♂️, and experimenting with culinary techniques in the kitchen 🍲. I'm also a big fan of learning new concepts and pushing boundaries to build impactful solutions.
